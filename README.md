# **Examining Common Disease and Vaccination Coverage Data from WHO.**

# Description

This project is intended to interact with the dataset from 2017 that was released by the World Health Organization, and as a guide to provide some basic cleaning, wrangling, and viewing ideas with R studio, and a brief discussion of some trends observed in the data set.

The dataset can be found [*here*](https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/blob/master/datasets/Vaccine%20Coverage%20and%20Disease%20Burden%20-%20WHO%20(2017)/Vaccine%20Coverage%20and%20Disease%20Burden%20-%20WHO%20(2017).csv).

The data set includes the number of cases and vaccine coverage of some common diseases. The time span includes from the 1970s to 2015, and the entities include independent data for nearly 200 countries, combined data for several continents, and overall data for the world.

Detailed information and explanations of the variables included can be found [*here*](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/topics/indicator-groups/indicator-group-details/GHO/immunization-coverage-estimates).
